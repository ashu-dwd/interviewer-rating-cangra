Transcript
Manoj Pawar: introduction about your experience.
svcc cc: Okay.
svcc cc: Hi, this is Si.
svcc cc: IT field coming to revelent 3.5 and I have involved of designing development monitoring testing like that come to the roles and responsibilities are like API development like using RAML and XML by using business requirements like fragments resource etc and system integrations integrated between the system to process layer right my banking project is Abidi banking project and…
svcc cc: get the requirements from the web applications and to exchange the API requirements, loan credit cards. Yeah, yes. Yes. Yeah,…
Manoj Pawar: 5 years in Wilson right?
Manoj Pawar: Have you done any certifications?
svcc cc: I have. MCT level one.
Manoj Pawar: …
Manoj Pawar: can you tell me what did you face? Any technical challenges and you've resolved that?
svcc cc: Yeah. database transformations.
Manoj Pawar: What challenges did you face?
svcc cc: So I have written some custom functions in order to overcome the challenges. Yes.
Manoj Pawar: And what list of connectors have you used?
svcc cc: HTTP listeners,…
Manoj Pawar: What list of mules of connectors have you used so far?
svcc cc: requesters, database connectors, Salesforce connectors, file connectors,…
Manoj Pawar: Have you used file processing,…
svcc cc: web services, consumers, web group, any point of Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: batch processing?
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't.
Manoj Pawar: So, how you will rate in data out of 10?
svcc cc: Yeah,…
Manoj Pawar: How you will rate in data view coding out of 10?
svcc cc: I'm very good. I can write mine.
Manoj Pawar: Can you share your screens?
svcc cc: Yeah, I'm okay.
Manoj Pawar: I'm giving you one problem statement.
svcc cc: Okay.
Manoj Pawar: So in chat I'm giving you one statement. I want highest salary from this data.
svcc cc: Yeah. Is it fine? Okay.
Manoj Pawar: Can you check the output I have given
svcc cc: the Same again, right?
Manoj Pawar: Okay, I'm giving you another statement.
00:05:00
Manoj Pawar: Yeah, I have given you an inch chatter.
Manoj Pawar: I want something.
svcc cc: Fine. Right. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Can you explain me the code?
svcc cc: Now I'm taking max by getting the maximum of salary and…
svcc cc: this is the object we need the only salary. like this.
Manoj Pawar: Okay, I'm doing a third program.
svcc cc: Okay.
00:10:00
svcc cc: Yeah.  Yeah, sure.
Manoj Pawar: Can you convert this data into CSV?
svcc cc: Yes.
Manoj Pawar: with PIPD limited Okay.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: What is file processing and how you used in your project file processing
svcc cc: It's Read write of patience and with respect to files. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Can you explain in your project…
Manoj Pawar: what was the source and how you use this connector in your project. H. So…
svcc cc: Coming to my project customer complements process need a file from the file server which is having one lakh of sectors in using bulk settings in database and…
Manoj Pawar: where that files were? So was it in FTP?
svcc cc: five server STP 57.
Manoj Pawar: So is it possible to get some filtered files from the folder?
svcc cc: Yeah. We can add a regular expressions pattern.
Manoj Pawar: Can we autodelete that file?
svcc cc: Come again.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. There is a delete operation or…
Manoj Pawar: Let's say okay let's take one example.
svcc cc: else make a new operation. Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: We have to read CSU file. the data is in pipe delimiting. So what configuration we do in FTP?
svcc cc: STP file read.
00:15:00
Manoj Pawar: What parameter…
svcc cc: Go to the m mind type.
Manoj Pawar: what configuration we will set in connector?
svcc cc: Go to my typeations of CSV.
Manoj Pawar: What will be the m type here and we need okay. what is batch processing?
svcc cc: Yeah. Large data process synchronous. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: So can you give me okay how did you use in your project?
svcc cc: Just now we have discovered right. I need to read some files or server which is having one of large data using batch job bulk insert data to the database table. Yeah, like that.
Manoj Pawar: What was your source here and…
svcc cc: SFTV file server.
Manoj Pawar: destination is database right?
svcc cc: Yes. Okay.
Manoj Pawar: So let's take one example in your FTP server we are having millions of records now and I have to push it to the Salesforce and I want final report for every record I want the status of Salesforce. So how we can do it in batch processing?
svcc cc: Roing batch is not possible.
Manoj Pawar: H no I parallel.
svcc cc: Why? Because it is asynchronous parach.
Manoj Pawar: No it is okay like how we can implement in batch processing.
svcc cc: Yeah. Coming to the batch all this inside the process records and…
Manoj Pawar: H yeah.
svcc cc: so create a batch step. Next load the dispatch records and…
Manoj Pawar: What are the components in batch processing? Mhm. So here…
svcc cc: all complete files.
Manoj Pawar: how we can capture the errors.
svcc cc: Create one more batch step only failure accept for that we can handle the failure thoughts.
Manoj Pawar: So how we can define the batch sizes is h okay.
svcc cc: No, by default it will 100. So we cany in based on the parallel system how many regards it will accept. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: So is there any limit while defining B sizing?
svcc cc: no. We should be out. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Okay. let's take one example. Just give me one minute. gentle. One second.
Manoj Pawar: Yeah. let's take an example. Now we have two requirements.
svcc cc: Okay.
Manoj Pawar: So one is synchronous project and second is asynchronous project. So we have got the requirement from So for both the projects what steps we will take we have got the requirement. So from step one till the QA or production deployment what are what step one you will do what in studio you will set up okay so can you tell me all this process
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. Any point platform design center designer and fragment specifications.
svcc cc: publish in the exchange. Next, using any point studio, import the RAM, implement the flows.  We can connect the components and langing, mapping, exception handling, MMS all done with DO and can be changes the depository and promote the higher environments. Is there any defect debugs the issues? Yeah, these are the activities.
00:20:00
svcc cc: created right I mentioned it right M& sockets discoveries in the development phase by creating separate properties Second properties we can define the DML QML both respect to the all edit inscriptions.
Manoj Pawar: And…
Manoj Pawar: what about the properties files API ID how you'll take care so h okay and what is secure properties and how you will take care while deploying So have you done deployment cloud hub on premises or…
svcc cc: Yeah. Till production I have done production other team they have done on premises and…
Manoj Pawar: is there any mule admin team what type of deployments have you done on premise cloud?
svcc cc: cloud hub. Yeah. Okay.
Manoj Pawar: So on premises can you elaborate more on premises? What was the end systems? How did you deploy it on premise?
svcc cc: Create a domain project with respect to pipeline CD that the application
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. what was the end system here on premise AWS Azure?
Manoj Pawar: What was the system?
svcc cc: It's a Linux.
Manoj Pawar: So you wrote that commands to build that deloy jar of the mule server is it?
svcc cc: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Relax. with respect to Mar.
Manoj Pawar: And what about the Linux commands to build the jar and start the mu server? you did that right?
svcc cc: Yes. Yes. Yes. I have done.
Manoj Pawar: Can you tell me the list of commands what you used from type one?
svcc cc: Yes. MVN screen install.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: Next. MVN deployment.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. Okay.
svcc cc: And these are the two I have done. Align change directory.
Manoj Pawar: And how did you start the M server? Uh-huh. Okay.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. Change directory to mule hole inside the start and stop self commands. I have one splank.
Manoj Pawar: Have you integrated your logs with the third party logger tools? Sorry. Okay.
svcc cc: Splunk. Okay.
Manoj Pawar: How did you integrate mulesoft with Splunk?
svcc cc: Coming to the long force change XML console URL and…
Manoj Pawar: H. Mhm.
svcc cc: password. go to the pom.xml and a spank library that go to and…
svcc cc: container manager html server. Yeah, by providing the Splunk URL and access to the token.
Manoj Pawar: So let's take one more example. so I have source system as a SAP and I have destination system as a Salesforce.  So from SAP there are some master data I have to pull and the size there are n number of records. So you are getting more than 10 lakh records okay for the master data for one flow.
00:25:00
Manoj Pawar: So I have to read that I have to do some data transformation in between and I have to push it to the sense at the end I have to make some report what was the input data and what was the response from the destination system. So here I have two three requirements. One is I want report final report.
Manoj Pawar: Second is there should not be any data loss in between.
svcc cc: Okay. …
Manoj Pawar: And third requirement is after some days or after next week maybe the code ran this week maybe next week or next month I want to see the data of the previous whatever is the run to debug that issue if there is any issue with the transaction I want to see that data pass data. Okay. So how we can design the system here?
svcc cc: Yeah, media data from SAP enable for streaming.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: Using batches and also can process the data. make a larger components. So that is long messages to correlation ID and contain.
svcc cc: So we can trace the knots.
Manoj Pawar: not to lose any data.
Manoj Pawar: So let's say there is a issue with Salesforce connection. So I don't want to lose my data. So how you will take care of this data?
svcc cc: Enable the streaming something error of without proging the payload and…
svcc cc: the process with respect to cues.
svcc cc: Guaranteed delivery reliability with respect to Q's.
Manoj Pawar: Let's take one example.
Manoj Pawar: Same example. Now it is running And on production I'm getting a lot of intermittent data issues. with the Salesforce I'm getting intermittent connection issues. there are some data issues. okay. So that team needs to look into so it is on production.
svcc cc: Okay. Mhm.
Manoj Pawar: This is there I have two requirements First requirement is how you will go to directly that step to debug that issue and what kind of enhancements you will do here. Okay. The one. Point number.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: So you just explain you the point number one then we'll discuss point number two. Mhm.
svcc cc: Coming to the point one as I said launch the messages with the correlation identity. so any error occur we'll get the alert correlation ID and as such the along correlation ID.
svcc cc: Next optimization purpose and enable the screening parallel processing. Yeah, these are the operations.
Manoj Pawar: H. So…
Manoj Pawar: what is correlation ID and how you will jump to that step with the correlation ID?
svcc cc: Yeah, whenever we are m generate I'm logging every no event will generate the correlation ID that I am reusing.
Manoj Pawar: So with every step there is correlation ID generating. Mhm. Okay.
Manoj Pawar: Are you using any patterns while logging? Is there any pattern?
svcc cc: Yeah. …
Manoj Pawar: What is the pattern?
svcc cc: what name app name?
Manoj Pawar: So…
svcc cc: So before sending the request JSON log I'm logging all these messages.
Manoj Pawar: what you said app name,…
Manoj Pawar: correlation, ed what is there other parameters in your pattern and…
svcc cc: Flow name slowing flow custom message.
Manoj Pawar: okay and more parameters is there any start Stop.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm defining whenever the flow start and before making it as a flowing.
Manoj Pawar: Okay.
svcc cc: These are the parameters.
Manoj Pawar: Coming to point number two. So in same project some customer has given some enhancements. So that enhancement will impact your current working.
00:30:00
Manoj Pawar: So there is a major impact on your current working and you have to do enhancement as well. So what steps you will take here.
svcc cc: I'm just ask the request next by the functionalities so that we can start…
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: where we want do the documentations get back the feedback.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: And…
Manoj Pawar: what about the impact there is a impact on your current working. So how you will deal with this.
svcc cc: I will maintain the versioning two different versions.
Manoj Pawar: So let's take one example you have built one API so …
Manoj Pawar: how we can enforce policies how we can use the autodiscore ID and set all the ies throttling policies your authentication policies here.
svcc cc: Go to the API manager.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. What is auto discover?
svcc cc: Apply the policies or to basic or security policies. Great limited policies application running in runtime manager.
Manoj Pawar: So Mhm.
svcc cc: This is the API manager. Yeah. With respect to the auto discovery.
Manoj Pawar: How you will define your API ID in your studio and we'll push it to Q in production.
svcc cc: Go to the global elements R2 discovery API ID that is from the property file.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. And…
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: how do you link autoor in any point platform?
svcc cc: When we deploy auto discovery along with any point studio client secret automatically it will register.
Manoj Pawar: Have you worked with rest ops?
svcc cc: Yes. Yes. Yes. Rest is lightweight.
Manoj Pawar: What is rest? So Mhm.
svcc cc: supporting HTTP protocol and next multi JSON XML.
svcc cc: Heavyweight and support you XML. We need the visitor file in order to publish to our consu. Yes. Yes.
Manoj Pawar: I want soap.
Manoj Pawar: Have you integrated incept the rest API ops? How we can externalize the data view code? Have you done that?
svcc cc: Yeah. External wise DW file.
Manoj Pawar: And how you can link in data.
svcc cc: A path resource names equal to complete part.
Manoj Pawar: So, how we can so let's say there is one main show. Okay. So,…
svcc cc: Okay. Mhm.
Manoj Pawar: and there are lot of flows in one project. I have a number of flows. So what are the best practices to capture the errors here.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah. You can do one is process level and…
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. So…
svcc cc: R4 level or global level handling.
Manoj Pawar: how we can configure global error handle here?
svcc cc: Create a separate XML. Drag and…
svcc cc: drop the error handler within a error handle.
svcc cc: So we on error propagate has a mutual error type. Yeah, we can handle.
Manoj Pawar: So currently you're working for Abu Dhabi police, So is it banking domain?
00:35:00
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Tell me one thing. So as a banking domain there is a PHI data, right? So as a PH data it should not be disclosed. So what?
svcc cc: Masking this entitive datas.
Manoj Pawar: What you are doing here? masking like …
Manoj Pawar: what you are doing is you're using any encryption how you are dealing with this sorry yeah…
svcc cc: Yeah,…
svcc cc: b database.
Manoj Pawar: but now it is in encryption while decryting what are you using Okay.
svcc cc: Yeah. decryption, the private public keys.
Manoj Pawar: So, how you implemented in this public keys.
svcc cc: Yeah, crypto encryption modules both the ways.
Manoj Pawar: Is it a part of data view or you use custom connectors here?
svcc cc: Both the way custom module Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Tell me another point. Now you must be logging data somewhere this transaction data is it you're logging somewhere on file server or something else.
svcc cc: Splank mask.
Manoj Pawar: Is this data with the encryption in Splunk?
svcc cc: Mask data.
Manoj Pawar: Okay. okay.
Manoj Pawar: Tell me one thing. so as a banking domain you must be getting lot of transaction data, did you face challenges initially you created one architecture…
svcc cc: Yes. That's cool.
Manoj Pawar: but after as a scalable approach their transactions are increased and you did the enhancement in your current flow. Is this happened with you?
svcc cc: No no no from starting onwards we are following the best practices get the usual the scaling of applications.
Manoj Pawar: So as a best practices So as Yeah.
svcc cc: Yeah, these are the best practices.
Manoj Pawar: Can you come again for banking customers what best practices you are following in MUOT?
svcc cc: Yeah. One is reusability and…
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: second one is horizontal vertical scaling. Next come to the coding level and…
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: enable the studio and processing. These are the best practices.
Manoj Pawar: What do you mean by reusability? How you are doing in m? Can you give me one example?
svcc cc: Yeah. Let the architecture I have created the system API reuse same the functionalities again and again.
Manoj Pawar: What is vertical and horizontal scaling?
svcc cc: No red coming request and increase the number of workers that is general scaling.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm.
svcc cc: Next bigger payload and…
svcc cc: so the avoid memory issues increase the big group memory that is vertical scale. I have taken vertical scaling avoid the issues.
Manoj Pawar: Mhm. Okay.
Manoj Pawar: Did you face any memory issues while processing records in Mu CPU or memory issues? Sorry. Okay.
svcc cc: Yes. Thank you. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: Okay Janti I'm good there any questions okay so Janti just focus more on batch processing okay and…
svcc cc: Okay.
Manoj Pawar: whenever there is a question you just go in deeper not only oneliner answer just explain thoroughly so as you said reusability right so you should give one example there are some pointers like I asked you regarding this scalable approach.
svcc cc: Okay.
00:40:00
Manoj Pawar: So what it is meaning you are just giving two words…
svcc cc: Okay.
Manoj Pawar: but just explain…
Manoj Pawar: what it will help and understood you just go in deeper and…
svcc cc: Okay. Yeah.
svcc cc: Yeah. Yeah.
Manoj Pawar: practice more data complex questions.
svcc cc: Okay.
Manoj Pawar: Okay. Thank you J.
svcc cc: Thank you.
